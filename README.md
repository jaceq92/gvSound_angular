# GVSound

GVSound is a modern multimedia site created with Angular 2. GVSound tries to make it easy to access content on various sites like Youtube
and Soundcloud. Our second goal is to make it easy to share this content with your friends. For example, creating playlists for your friend group that all of you can see and edit songs on it.

## Features
- Add content from Youtube and SoundCloud with a custom made search tool
- Form playlists where you can mix content from both Youtube and SoundCloud
- Drag'n'Drop songs to make your own queues in a playlist
- Toggle video when playing Youtube content and even go fullscreen!

## ToDo
- SoundCloud playback currently works only in Chrome for some reason.
- Add login functionality.
- Better media control. Volume slider, progress slider etc.
- Upgrade to Angular 2 release version.
- Implement some kind of build system to bundle and minify files for publish.
