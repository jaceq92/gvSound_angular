# gvSound_angular

gvSound is a modern multimedia site created with Angular 2. gvSound tries to make it easy to access content on various sites like Youtube
and Soundcloud. Our second goal is to make it easy to share this content with your friends. For example, creating playlists for your friend
group that all of you can see and edit songs on it.
